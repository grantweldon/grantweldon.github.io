My research interests are in high-energy astrophysics and general relativity. I currently study gravitational wave astrophysics as a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a>.

General relativity (GR), Einstein's theory of gravitation, describes the curvature of spacetime sourced by a distribution of mass and energy. Within GR, radiation propagates as <i>gravitational waves</i>, ripples in spacetime. In 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration detected the first gravitational waves from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03837">binary black hole merger</a>. The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration has since detected several more binary black hole mergers, as well as one <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05832">binary neutron star merger</a>. These observations allow for empirical tests of general relativity (and beyond-GR alternatives) inn the strong-field, dynamical regime.

In addition, searches are underway for faint, persistent signals in LIGO-Virgo data. These <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05897">continuous waves</a> (CWs) are predicted to radiate from non-axisymmetric, rapidly spinning neutron stars. A CW detection would provide insight into the neutron star equation of state and fundamental nuclear physics in extreme realms. While no CWs have been detected, upper limits on have their amplitude have been placed. My research focuses on developing data analysis techniques for CW searches.
