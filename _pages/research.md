{% include base_path %} I currently study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational-wave_astronomy">gravitational wave astrophysics</a> as a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a>.

<b>Overview</b>

General relativity (GR), Einstein's theory of gravitation, describes the curvature of spacetime sourced by a distribution of mass or energy. Within GR, high-energy astrophysical phenomena generate <i>gravitational waves</i>, ripples in the fabric spacetime. In 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration detected the first gravitational waves from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03837">binary black hole merger</a>. The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration has since detected several more binary black hole mergers, as well as one <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05832">binary neutron star merger</a>. These observations were made using a global network of 3-4 kilometer laser interferometers. Additional gravitational waves continue to be observed as the interferometers become increasingly sensitive. The detected waveforms allow for empirical tests of general relativity (and beyond-GR alternatives) in the strong-field, dynamical regime.

Furthermore, searches are underway for yet-undetected, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05897">continuous waves</a> (CWs) from rapidly spinning neutron stars. In addition to probing strong-field gravity, a CW observation would constrain the neutron star equation of state, providing insight into fundamental nuclear physics under extreme conditions. My current research focuses on developing data analysis techniques for CW searches.
