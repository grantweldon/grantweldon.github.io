{% include base_path %} I currently study gravitational wave astrophysics as a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a>.

<b>Overview</b>

General relativity (GR), Einstein's theory of gravitation, describes the curvature of spacetime sourced by a distribution of mass and energy. Within GR, radiation propagates as <i>gravitational waves</i>, ripples in spacetime. In 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration detected the first gravitational waves from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03837">binary black hole merger</a>. The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration has since detected several more binary black hole mergers, as well as one <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05832">binary neutron star merger</a>. Gravitational wave observations are made using a global network of 4-kilometer Michelson laser interferometers. The detected waveforms allow for empirical tests of general relativity (and beyond-GR alternatives) in the strong-field, dynamical regime. Additionally, searches are underway for yet-undetected, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05897">continuous waves</a> (CWs) from rapidly spinning neutron stars. My current research focuses on developing data analysis techniques for CW searches.
