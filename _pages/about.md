I am an undergraduate physics student and <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholar</a> at the University of Michigan. My research interests are in general relativity and high-energy astrophysics. Of especial importance to these studies are compact objects (e.g. black holes, neutron stars) and their emitted radiation. I currently conduct research on gravitational waves with the <a href="http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/MGWG.html">Riles group</a>. In particular, we perform searches for continuous gravitational waves, predicted to radiate from rapidly spinning neutron stars.

I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the American Physical Society Division of Gravitational Physics.
