I am an undergraduate physics student at the University of Michigan, where I am a recipient of the <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholarship</a>. My research interests are in general relativity and high-energy astrophysics. Of particular relevance to these studies are compact objects (*e.g.* black holes, neutron stars) and the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw">gravitational waves</a> they emit. 

I currently conduct gravitational wave research with the <a href="http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/MGWG.html">Riles group</a>, supported in part by the National Science Foundation. We perform searches for continuous waves, as predicted to radiate from spinning neutron stars. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the American Physical Society Division of Gravitational Physics.

I have also contributed to the development of gravitational wave instrumentation with the <a href="http://www.virgo-gw.eu">Virgo Collaboration</a> and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) as a DOE-INFN Fellow.
