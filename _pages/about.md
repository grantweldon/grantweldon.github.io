I am an undergraduate physics and mathematics student at the University of Michigan, where I am a recipient of the <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholarship</a>. My research interests are in general relativity and relativistic astrophysics. Central to these studies are compact objects (*e.g.* black holes, neutron stars) and <a href="https://space.mit.edu/LIGO/more.html">gravitational waves</a>.

I currently work with the <a href="http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/MGWG.html">Michigan Gravitational Wave Group</a>. We develop computational methods to search for continuous waves in interferometer data, as predicted to radiate from spinning neutron stars. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the American Physical Society Division of Gravitational Physics.
