I am an undergraduate physics student at the University of Michigan, where I am a recipient of the <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholarship</a>. My research interests are in general relativity and high-energy astrophysics. Of particular importance are compact objects (*e.g.* black holes, neutron stars) and their associated radiation. I currently conduct research on gravitational wave astrophysics with the <a href="http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/MGWG.html">Riles group</a>. Our work focuses on searching for continuous gravitational waves, as predicted to radiate from spinning neutron stars.

I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the American Physical Society Division of Gravitational Physics.
