I am an undergraduate physics and mathematics student at the University of Michigan, where I am a recipient of the <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholarship</a>. My research interests are in general relativity and relativistic astrophysics. Central to these studies are compact objects (*e.g.* black holes, neutron stars) and <a href="https://space.mit.edu/LIGO/more.html">gravitational waves</a>.

I work with the <a href="http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/MGWG.html">Michigan Gravitational Wave Group</a> and <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> to search for continuous waves from spinning neutron stars. I currently conduct research with the <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/astrophysics/gravity/">NASA Gravitational Astrophysics Laboratory</a> for the upcoming <a href="https://lisa.nasa.gov">LISA</a> mission, a space-based gravitational wave observatory. Previously, I developed gravitational wave instrumentation with the <a href="http://www.virgo-gw.eu">Virgo Collaboration</a> in Italy.
