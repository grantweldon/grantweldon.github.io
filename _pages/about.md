I am an undergraduate physics student at the University of Michigan, where I am a recipient of the <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholarship</a>. My research interests are in general relativity and high-energy astrophysics. Of particular relevance to these studies are compact objects (*e.g.* black holes, neutron stars). 

I currently conduct research on gravitational waves with the <a href="http://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/MGWG.html">Riles group</a>, supported in part by the National Science Foundation. Our work focuses on searching for continuous waves, as predicted to radiate from spinning neutron stars. I am a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the American Physical Society Division of Gravitational Physics.

I have previously studied gravitational wave physics with the <a href="http://www.virgo-gw.eu">Virgo Collaboration</a> and the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) of Italy as a DOE-INFN Fellow.
