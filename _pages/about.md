I am an undergraduate <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholar</a> at the University of Michigan studying physics and mathematics. My research interests are in general relativity and high-energy astrophysics. I currently conduct research on gravitational waves with Professor Keith Riles as a member of the <a href="https://www.ligo.org">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a>.
