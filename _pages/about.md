I am an undergraduate <a href="https://shipmansociety.com/about-us/">Shipman Scholar</a> at the University of Michigan studying physics and mathematics. My research interests are in high-energy astrophysics and general relativity. I currently conduct research on gravitational wave astrophysics with Professor Keith Riles as a member of the <a href="https://ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO Scientific Collaboration</a> and the <a href="http://public.virgo-gw.eu/the-virgo-collaboration/">Virgo Collaboration</a>.

I am a member of the American Physical Society and serve as Vice President of the Michigan Society of Physics Students.
